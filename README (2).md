# Random Forest Regressor

**Project:** House Price Prediction (multiple techniques)

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`House_Price_Prediction_USING_all_techniquesipynb.ipynb`) that experiments with several machine learning techniques to predict house prices. The notebook covers data loading, exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training with multiple algorithms, evaluation, and comparison.

## Contents
- `House_Price_Prediction_USING_all_techniquesipynb.ipynb` — main notebook with code and explanations.
- `README.md` — this file.
- `requirements.txt` — list of Python packages (generate using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).

## Key libraries detected
matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn

## Models & Techniques attempted (detected)
DecisionTree, KNN, Lasso, LinearRegression, RandomForest, Ridge

## Preprocessing steps detected
scaling

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>.git
cd <your-repo-folder>
```
2. Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# then open House_Price_Prediction_USING_all_techniquesipynb.ipynb
```

## Notebook structure
- Data loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Feature engineering / selection
- Model training (multiple algorithms)
- Evaluation and comparison (MAE, RMSE, R^2, etc.)
- Conclusions and next steps
